              <p>Every major AI provider — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral — bills in USD on a credit card. For a developer in Dhaka or Sylhet, that's three layers of friction: getting an international card, paying conversion fees, and absorbing exchange-rate risk on every request.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile the actual integration work is identical across providers. Same OpenAI-shaped chat-completions schema. Same streaming protocol. Same headers. So we built one endpoint, one key, one bill — paid in BDT.</p>

              <p>One API key gives you 50+ models across every major provider. We normalize errors, expose a single billing surface, route around outages, and price everything in BDT per million tokens at the prevailing rate.</p>
              <p>Top up with bKash, Nagad, Rocket, card, or USDT. Credits never expire. Switch models with a string change.</p>

              <p>A small per-request margin on top of the upstream provider's wholesale rate. No subscription tiers, no minimums, no enterprise sales calls required to read pricing.</p>
