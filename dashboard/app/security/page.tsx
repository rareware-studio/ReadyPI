The plaintext is shown to you exactly once at creation; the database stores only a bcrypt hash with cost factor 12.</p>
              <p>Each key is scoped to a single workspace and can carry an optional monthly BDT spend cap. Revocation is instant — within milliseconds the key is invalidated across every gateway node.</p>

Email <a href="mailto:security@readypi.io" className="text-[#ff6b4a] underline">security@readypi.io</a> with reproduction steps.
