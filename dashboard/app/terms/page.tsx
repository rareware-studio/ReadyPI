              <p>ReadyPi is an API gateway operated by Rareware Studio (Sylhet, Bangladesh) that proxies requests to third-party AI model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, Meta, DeepSeek, Mistral, and others). You bring a ReadyPi API key; we route the request, bill credits in BDT, and return the provider's response.</p>
              <p>We do not own or operate the underlying models. Output quality, availability, and content policies are governed by the upstream provider for the model you select.</p>

            <>
              <p>You are responsible for keeping your account credentials and API keys secret. Treat keys like passwords. We will never ask for your key over email or chat.</p>
              <p>Any usage that originates from your key is billed to your account. If a key is compromised, revoke it from the dashboard immediately and rotate to a new one.</p>

            <>
              <p>You may not use ReadyPi to generate content that is illegal under Bangladeshi or applicable jurisdictional law, that targets or harasses individuals, that infringes copyright, or that attempts to defeat the safety guardrails of upstream providers. We honor the acceptable-use policies of every provider we integrate with — abuse on one provider can suspend your access to all of them.</p>
              <p>Automated abuse, scraping that violates a provider's terms, and reselling raw API access without an integration are prohibited.</p>

          body: (
            <>
              <p>ReadyPi runs on a prepaid credit model denominated in Bangladeshi Taka (BDT). You top up credits via bKash, Nagad, Rocket, card, or USDT, and each request deducts credits at the published BDT-per-million-token rate for the model used.</p>
              <p>Pricing per model is shown on the Models page and may change with 30 days' notice. Credits do not expire and are not refundable in cash, but unused balances can be applied to any future request on any model.</p>

              <p>We target 99.9% gateway uptime but cannot guarantee the availability of any individual upstream provider. When a provider is degraded, ReadyPi's fallback routing will attempt an equivalent model on a healthy provider unless you have explicitly disabled fallbacks.</p>
              <p>Scheduled maintenance is announced in advance on the status page.</p>

              <p>The service is provided "as is". To the maximum extent permitted by law, ReadyPi's aggregate liability is capped at the credits you spent in the 30 days preceding the claim. We are not liable for upstream provider outages, model output quality, or any indirect damages.</p>
